<h3 align="center">I'm a PHP Backend Developer.</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Freelancer, currently on 2 Proyects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **English** to enroll into **BYU-Idaho** in a *Tech Career*.
- ✨ I wish to learn **React, Vue, Python and C#**

I'm 23 years old and I'm passionate about programming! Since March 2020 I have not stopped learning and loving this profession more. I'm very good working as a team, and I interact quickly with others. Honesty, Integrity and Moral Values govern my life, my study and my work.
I have great ability to follow directives, learn quickly, plan and organize to adapt to different work schedules.
I want to continue expanding my knowledge, my plans are to be able to learn JS frameworks such as React, Angular and Vue; and learn other languages like Python and C#.
